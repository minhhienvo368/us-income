## Model evaluation challenge - US Income
  + Repository name: us-income
  + Duration: 1 day
  + Deadline: 16/Aug/2021 04:30 PM
  + Datasets:  data_train.csv and data_test.csv 
    - ../../../additional_resources/datasets/US Income/cleaned/data_train.csv
    - ../../../additional_resources/datasets/US Income/cleaned/data_test.csv 
#### Must-have features
  + Baseline accuracy
  + Multiple evaluation metrics
  + Hyper parameter tuning
  + Some type of validation strategy

#### Constraints
  + You must use RandomForestClassifier() from sklearn. We want you to focus on model evaluation, not on the model choice nor on the data preprocessing.
  + Create functions, do not create a single huge script
  + Each function or class has to be typed
  + Each function or class has to contain a docstring in a consistent format.
  + Your code should be formatted with black.
  + Your code should be commented.
  + Your code should be cleaned of any commented unused code.
